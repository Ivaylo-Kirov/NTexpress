basic express server with GET and POST routes and enables static assets to be served

* Round 2
Added a static html file served with res.sendFile() and a parameterized GET that accepts param in req.params and just returns it

* Round 3 - added sequelize and hooked up to RDS (MySQL) - connected and ran an insert - Sequelize auto creates the table using the Model definition
